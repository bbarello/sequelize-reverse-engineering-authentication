# Sequelize Reverse Engineering Authentication


Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code using Node.js, 
Sequelize and Passport.

## Description:

```

When a developer joins a new team, they will be expected to inspect a lot of code that they 
have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, 
the developer will dissect the code by themselves, saving any questions for a member of your 
team. As developer you want to walk-through the codebase using Node.js, Sequelize and Passport
so that you can use it as a starting point for a new project.
